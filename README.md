# BlockServerCMDs
### The solution to all the AuthMe and BungeeCord users

This plugin allows you to block any BungeeCord or Spigot command when a player is in a configurable list of servers.

This plugin can be used in all the Cracked/No Premium login servers replacing the crap ton of plugins used to block all the commands from this server (That usually uses AuthMe or another kind of auth plugin that doesn't offer a BungeeCord command blocker).

## Installation
You can go to [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/blockservercmds.9349/) for already compiled JARs.

You will need to clone this repo and package it with Maven:
```
git clone git@github.com:hugmanrique/BlockServerCMDs.git
cd BlockServerCMDs
mvn package
```

You will find your packaged JAR inside of the target folder. You can move this
